Tavake Beachfront Bungalow is a fully self-contained studio bungalow located on the western edge of Muri Beach, one of Rarotonga's most iconic destinations. This intimate property offers the perfect escape for couples or solo travelers seeking a beachfront experience with easy access to local amenities and water activities. Wake up to the gentle sounds of lapping waves just feet away from your private bungalow with spectacular lagoon views—pure bliss.

The property is part of a small family-owned cluster of beachfront bungalows, each privately owned and operated. The studio features a comfortable queen bed and a couch for additional sleeping space, along with direct beach views that create an intimate and relaxing setting. The stylish bathroom provides ample storage space for luggage with a well-appointed and functional design.

The fully equipped kitchen includes everything you need for meal preparation—a fridge, microwave, kettle, and ceramic cooktop—along with a dining and living area perfect for unwinding after a day of island exploration. Step outside to enjoy your beachfront location with direct beach access via a private pathway next to Ironwood Trees. Complimentary outdoor beach chairs, mats, and snorkel gear are provided so you can make the most of the stunning lagoon right at your doorstep.

Water activities abound with the ability to swim out to the Motus (small islands), while kayak and SUP board rentals are available from Captain Tama's nearby. The Fruits of Raro marine reserve is just a few minutes away, offering exceptional snorkeling opportunities. Bars, cafes, and restaurants are within a short, leisurely walk, with downtown Muri accessible by heading east along the road. With free parking on the premises, WiFi access, and TV with standard cable, you'll have all the comforts you need for your island getaway.
